This is my first C programming language project.

Ä°ntroduction

This code is a simple password generator written in the C programming language. It generates a random password of 24 characters long, using a variety of characters, including lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Technical details

The code uses the following functions:
getCharset(): This function returns a pointer to a string that contains all the characters that can be used in the password.
generatePassword(): This function generates a random password of the specified length, using the characters from the getCharset() function.
printf(): This function is used to print the generated password to the console.

Testing
The code was tested using the following methods:
Manual testing: The code was manually tested by generating a few different passwords and checking to make sure that they were of the correct length and included a variety of characters.
Unit testing: A few unit tests were written to test the getCharset() and generatePassword() functions.

Conclusion
This code is a simple but effective password generator. It can be used to generate strong passwords that are difficult to crack. The code is well-tested and is easy to understand.
I hope this helps!
